# __2025 MLB Pitch-Level Analysis__

## __Objective:__
Identify the most effective individual pitch in MLB during the 2025 season using publicly available pitch-level outcome metrics.


## __Methods:__ 
Using __Baseball Savant’s 2025 Pitch Arsenal Stats Leaderboard__, I analyzed every pitch thrown at least 406 times (Baseball Savant’s qualifier) in 2025. To evaluate overall effectiveness, each pitch was ranked across key performance metrics — ***Run Value, RV/100, Batting Average (BA), Slugging Percentage (SLG), Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA), Strikeout Percentage (K%), Put-Away Percentage, and their expected and hard-hit variants*** — using Excel’s __RANK.EQ__ function. Rankings were summed to create an overall performance score, with lower totals indicating stronger overall effectiveness.

## __Results:__
Mason Miller's slider ranked as the overall top-performing pitch among all qualifying pitches.

## ___Mason Miller’s SL Rankings:___
- Run Value (18th)
- ***RV/100 (1st)***
- ***Batting Average (1st)***
- ***Slugging Percentage (1st)***
- ***Weighted On-Base Average (1st)***
- Strikeout Percentage (3rd)
- ***Put-Away Percentage (1st)***
- Expected Batting Average (8th)
- Expected Slugging Percentage (3rd)
- Expected Weighted On-Base Average (3rd)
- Hard-Hit Percentage (20th)

## __Conclusion:__
Miller's slider demonstrates elite effectiveness across both contact suppression and swing-and-miss metrics. This statistical dominance aligns with its notable velocity and late break, making it the most consistently effective pitch in MLB during the 2025 season. However, it would be valuable to quantify the specific movement and velocity characteristics that contributed to Miller's slider ranking 1st overall. Further research could explore the relationship between pitch characteristics (e.g., vertical drop, horizontal break) and overall effectiveness as measured in this study.
